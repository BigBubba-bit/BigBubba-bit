- 👋 Hi, I’m Pratham Patel, or @BigBubba-bit, and I am a Canadian-born Indian who enjoys programming and can't wait to code some more!
- 👀 I’m interested in machine learning and GUIs, overall more front-end engineering, as well as some hardware projects.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Computer Engineering at the University of Guelph, graduating in 2025.
